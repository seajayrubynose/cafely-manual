# 👨‍💻 Cafel.ly Developer Journal

## 📑 About the project

Cafe.ly is a review site like Yelp, IMDB, Metacritic, or RottenTomatoes, but for ☕Coffee! This is our finals project for CIT 214 Software Engineering.

## 🤔 How we came up with it

For our final Software Engineering project, we were instructed to build an app around a simple prompt given to us.

The prompt that we received was a **✨Product Rating Application✨**

We started by brainstorming ideas on what kind of app we should build. We finalized and voted between two app ideas:

1. An ecommerce store with a product rating feature.
2. A social product rating app.

Since there were already existing prompts for ecommerce stores among our class, it would be unnecessary to make build an app in the same category.

We wanted to build something different which is why we decided to go for **A social product rating app**.

This is inspired by already existing social product rating/review apps out there like [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) or [MetaCritic](https://www.metacritic.com/). They don't own any of the products but provide a platform for people in the same niche to communicate and share their thoughts about their favorite shows or products. Knowing this, we also decided to narrow down our niche by only creating a platform for **coffee lovers** to do the same thing!

## 💻 The tech stack

Cafe.ly is a full-stack web-application project deployed on Vercel that makes use of a serverless architecture. It's overkill but the website is constructed with the MERN Stack in mind. As such, the website is built with MongoDB, Express, and ReactJS. However, Express is exported as a serverless function for the backend for its APIs which is located in the /api folder.

### ⚛ Front-End

1. React
2. Tailwind

### 🗃 Back-End & Database

1. Express (Exported as a serverless function)
2. Firebase (Authentication)
3. MongoDB (Real-time database)
4. Vercel (Deployment)
