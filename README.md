## 🏷️ About

This is an Static-Site Generated documentation/blog site. Part of the course requirements for our CIT 214 - Software Engineeering class.

🔺 Made with NextJS & Deployed on Vercel

## ✍ Authors Notes

- A website wasn't required for the user manual but we took the opportunity to learn and build a site that uses `.md` files as the source of truth for the content on the website.

- We simply edit or add new `.md` files on the `/content` folder and the site automatically parses and builds the pages for each content.

- This is possible thanks to `next-mdx-remote`
